# Ruby Methods Lab

In this lab, you will write 3 methods:

1. `hello_world` that takes no arguments and returns a string.
2. `draft_pick` which takes 2 arguments - player and team - and returns a string.
3. `ruby_noob` takes a default argument subject set to "Ruby".

Define all these methods inside the file `methods.rb`. Good luck!
