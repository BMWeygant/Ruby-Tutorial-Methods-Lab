# Ruby Methods Lab
<strong>This guide assumes you have Ruby installed on your machine, a text editor, and a Github account already in place.</strong>

In this lab, you will write 3 methods:

1. `hello_world` that takes no arguments and returns a string.
2. `draft_pick` which takes 2 arguments - player and team - and returns a string.
3. `ruby_noob` takes a default argument subject set to "Ruby".

Define all these methods inside the file `methods.rb`. Good luck!

# Installation

```
git clone {repo url}
```

This will create a repository in your github and download your repo to your local machine so you can start working on it. When you solved all test cases follow thes steps:

```
